# :computer: :speaker: :musical_note: dos adlib banger notes
Notes on rendering adlib opl midi using real or emulated hardware.

## Easy Mode
* Foobar2000 + foo_midi http://www.foobar2000.org/ + http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_midi

## Hard Mode
* libADLMidi player (includes fatman and DMXOPL patch banks) https://github.com/Wohlstand/libADLMIDI
* DMXOPL patch bank https://github.com/sneakernets/DMXOPL

## DOS PLAYERS
* Some of these do Karaoke, and can drive external midi, not all can do adlib http://dosprograms.info.tt/sound.htm

## Alternatives
You can get _really close_ with sound fonts! This can be useful in setups where emulation is not desirable! Play these with something like `Fluidsynth` or any soundfont capable player.
